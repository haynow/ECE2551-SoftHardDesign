## Homework 0
Solve the following problems for your first homework. During your lab time this week, I'll be asking questions about the tasks. This is to ensure that you have a working setup.
During lab time next week, I'll sit one-by-one with you to assign a grade to your efforts. You must, however, **submit your homework in Canvas by Monday, August 31st**.

* **Question #0A:** Write a program that determines whether a number is **prime** or not. Use recursion to implement this behavior. The program should validate all input. 

```
Input a positive number: 3
Is number 3 prime?: Yes

Would you like to try another number? (Yes = 1 / No = 0): 1

Input a positive number: 6
Is number 3 prime?: No

Would you like to try another number? (Yes = 1 / No = 0): 0
```

Once you are done with this section, you should have 1 file containing your solution, main.cpp. Compress that file into a zip archive and submit it under the Hwk0A dropbox.
Name your file `<tracksID>.zip` where you replace *tracksID* for your current ID. For instance, if my tracks ID is xmerino2012, then I would submit `xmerino2012.zip`

* **Question #0B:** Use Euclid's algorithm to find the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of two numbers. Use recursion to implement this behavior. The program should validate all input. Watch the video below to understand how the algorithm works.
